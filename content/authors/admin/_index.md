My Name is Md Mintu Miah and I am a highly motivated, and self-dependent Ph.D. Research Assistant of Transportation Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). My research focuses on Data Mining and Machine Learning Techniques in the era of Transportation Engineering Data. Currently, I am developing Direct Demand Model (DDM) and applying Machine learning techniques to estimate Average Annual Daily Bicycle Traffic (AADBT) from short term sensor data from Portland, Oregon, this project is funded by NITC. My previous research was on Transportation Materials, Traffic safety, Distracted Driving Study, Para-transit and Micro-Transit barriers and Opportunities. I am open for Internship opportunities in the field of Transportation.
